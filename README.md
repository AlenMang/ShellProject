# ShellProject

Hi this is my little shell project, this is what you should know about my code.

FUNCTIONS RETURN VALUE
if function returns 2 this means that the reason is not too serious and user can couninue using program.

FILES
I used two files for history and prompt because their size is undefined so that's why i didn't allocate space for their information and used files.

END

i used many comments in my code so hope you'll not get confused.
